# polars_training
Repository for training on Polars.  After some time hearing about Polars, it seems it was time to at least give the library a shot at accelerating data wrangling.

## Lazy API 
This is admittidally different and interesting. For the most part, no comparisons are going to be run to validate any claims by the Polars team around speed.  It is the trainer's opinion that the performance speed will be dwarfed by the speed of syntax production for most work.  Hence learning the syntax is more critical for capturing the value of using the Polars library.
